config-app
==========

This project exists for me to learn a bit about GHCJS and to provide a
live demonstration of my config-value and config-schema packages.

When this project is compiled with GHCJS it produces this page:

https://glguy.net/config-demo

When this project is compiled on macOS, it produces a standalone
app bundle using a WebKit WebView control.


This project also serves as my chance to learn a bit about compilation
with Nix.
